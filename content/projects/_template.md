## Overview

Briefly explain:

- What the project does
- The problem it solves
- Who it’s for (you, club, users, learning)

This should be readable in under 30 seconds.

---

## Goals

What you set out to accomplish.

- Learn a new framework or concept
- Solve a specific technical problem
- Build a portfolio-quality artifact

Clear intent matters more than polish.

---

## Architecture & Approach

Describe the **high-level design**.

- Tech stack choices and why
- Key components/modules
- Data flow or system boundaries

No need for code — this is conceptual.

---

## Key Features / Work Completed

List concrete outcomes.

- Implemented X
- Integrated Y
- Automated Z

Use bullets; be specific.

---

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

Call out the interesting parts.

- What was harder than expected?
- Tradeoffs you made (simplicity vs flexibility, speed vs correctness)
- Constraints you worked under

This shows engineering judgment.

---

## What I Learned

Summarize takeaways.

- New tools or patterns
- Reinforced fundamentals
- Things you’d do differently next time

Short bullets work best.

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

What’s planned or intentionally deferred.

- Feature ideas
- Refactors
- Related projects

Optional but great for showing momentum.
